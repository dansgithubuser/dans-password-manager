# Dan's Password Manager
A free, open-source, easy-to-deploy, web-based password manager for teams.

Use at your own risk -- I can only offer my personal blessing that the crypto here is correct.

## Deploy
### Heroku
- `git clone --recursive`
- `cd dans-password-manager`
- ensure you're logged into Heroku CLI
- `python go.py -d`

## Alternatives
- KeePass -- not web-based
- BitWarden -- not free for teams
- Padlock -- not web-based
- Passbolt -- account required to get installation instructions
- Clipperz -- "The open source version of Clipperz is suitable for testing and educational purposes only."
